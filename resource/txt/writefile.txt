To celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region and highlight its performance arts, the National Centre for the Performing Arts in Beijing is hosting a series of shows from April 24 to 27 during Liuzhou Cultural Week.

Outstanding dramas including Dong, White Lotus and Great Folk Songs of Guangxi are to be performed during the cultural week, under the direction of Zhang Jigang and in collaboration with Liuzhou. The poetic dance Dong, created over six years, was once performed in Beijing as a recommended drama to foreign reporters during the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation.

A tourism promotion event was also held Tuesday night to showcase the rich tourism resources of Liuzhou city in Guangxi and its multiethnic cultures.

Liuzhou city, the largest industrial city in Guangxi, has picturesque scenery and a long history of more than 2,000 years.
