There’s a reason you never see any photos of Kanye West out with his family during one of their vacations and it’s not because he wants some privacy. He just prefers to be sleeping. But social media lover Kim Kardashian West managed to pry the rapper from his bed for a quick photo during one of the West family’s recent trips.

Kardashian West sat on the edge of West’s lap as he lounged in a beach chair by the ocean wearing a t-shirt, shorts and the same pair of Yeezy slides he wore to rapper 2 Chainz’s wedding last weekend. The KKW Beauty mogul showed off her toned abs in a strapless black bikini with high-cut bottoms for the shot.

“On vacay he just likes 800-420-7240 to sleep but I got him out for 5 mins for a pic,” Kardashian West captioned the photo.


Kardashian West has been showing plenty of skin on the beach recently in an assortment of sexy swimsuits.
